# libddwaf-rust

This project's goal is to produce a higher level API for the Rust bindings to libddwaf: DataDog in-app WAF. It consists of 2 separate entities: the bindings for the calls to libddwaf, and the encoder which job is to convert any go value to its libddwaf object representation.

## Warning

This library is still in **preview**
